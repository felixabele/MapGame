MapGame
=======

A simple game with maps

This is still a very early version and more of a test-application for my CoffeeScript skills.
Beside this my focus is on TDD and any new kick-ass features provided by Rails 3.2.6.

Game

to come:
    "Indicate a City on an empty map"
    "Guess the distance from one city to another"
    ...
