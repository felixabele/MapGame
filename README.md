MapGame
=======

A simple game with maps and cities

This is still a very early version and more of a test-application for my CoffeeScript skills.
Beside this my focus is on TDD and any new kick-ass features provided by Rails 3.2.6.

Game
=======
Till now you have:
    "10 biggest cities of .. Germany, Spain, Italy, France and Great Britain"
    and "Indicate a City on an empty map"
    and Random Cities for each maps for infintiv fun.

to come:
    "Guess the distance from one city to another"
    ...

Demo
=======
Here you can try a Demo to check the status quo
